- 🧠 **NeuroReactor** *(WIP)*  
  A second brain for ethical hackers.  
  → Local-first tool that augments your terminal or dev environment with an AI reasoning core.  
  → Think real-time thoughts + commands piped into a personal LLM for exploit dev and debugging.

- 🎮 **Dodge the Fireball**  
  My first full-featured **Pygame** project.  
  → Features: custom menu, retry button, background music, sound FX, enemy logic, image buttons, and more.
